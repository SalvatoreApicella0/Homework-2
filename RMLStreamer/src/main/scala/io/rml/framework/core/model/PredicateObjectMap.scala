/**
  * This trait defines a predicate- object map.
  * A predicate-object map is a function that creates
  * one or more predicate-object pairs for each row/record/element/object of a logical source.
  * It is used in conjunction with a subject map to generate RDF triples in a triples map.
  * A predicate-object map is represented by a resource that references the following other resources:
  * - One or more predicate maps.
  * - One or more object maps or referencing object maps.
  *
